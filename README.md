# Project-Module-3

The goal of this competition is the prediction of the price of diamonds based on their characteristics (weight, color, quality of cut, etc.). 

# Project Description

Work with data to understand the characteristics of a diamond which are most likely to influence its price.

# Metrics

The metric of success is, of course, MONEY ðŸ’²ðŸ’°ðŸ’²ðŸ’°ðŸ’²
Our assignment is to estimate the price of diamonds achieving the smallest amount of error, so he can sell or buy them properly.
We will specifically measure the root mean squared error (RMSE) of our predictions.

# Tech

Python @ Jupyter Notebook
Pandas / Numpy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Sklearn (LinearRegression / mean_squared_error)
